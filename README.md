# ScratchRebuilt

A block-based visual programming environment built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — inspired by MIT's Scratch, but fully self-coded without frameworks or libraries.

This project recreates the logic and interaction of Scratch while introducing new features like custom physics blocks, runtime execution, and more — all from first principles.

---

##  Features

-  Drag-and-drop blocks with snapping
-  Unique ID and block chaining logic
-  Group movement of attached blocks
-  Manual dragging with smooth mouse tracking
-  Visual block execution with glowing animation
-  Custom blocks planned: gravity, collision, sorting, 2D logic, etc.

---

##  Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS (UI layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (logic + execution engine)
- DOM-based architecture (no external libraries)

---

##  Roadmap (In Progress)

- [ ] Block cloning with unique IDs
- [ ] Block attachment + group movement
- [ ] Highlighting executing block
- [ ] Sprite logic system (multi-agent support)
- [ ] Event-driven scripting (`when key pressed`, `on start`)
- [ ] Execution engine for script blocks
- [ ] Save/load projects as JSON
- [ ] Custom user-defined blocks
