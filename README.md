# ScratchRebuilt

🎮 A block-based visual programming environment built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — inspired by MIT's Scratch, but fully self-coded without frameworks or libraries.

This project recreates the logic and interaction of Scratch while introducing new features like custom physics blocks, runtime execution, and more — all from first principles.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧱 Drag-and-drop blocks with snapping
- 🧠 Unique ID and block chaining logic
- 🧊 Group movement of attached blocks
- 🔁 Manual dragging with smooth mouse tracking
- 🔗 Visual block execution with glowing animation
- 🎮 Custom blocks planned: gravity, collision, sorting, 2D logic, etc.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS (UI layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (logic + execution engine)
- DOM-based architecture (no external libraries)

---

## 🚧 Roadmap (In Progress)

- [ ] Block cloning with unique IDs
- [ ] Block attachment + group movement
- [ ] Highlighting executing block
- [ ] Sprite logic system (multi-agent support)
- [ ] Event-driven scripting (`when key pressed`, `on start`)
- [ ] Execution engine for script blocks
- [ ] Save/load projects as JSON
- [ ] Custom user-defined blocks

## 🙋‍♂️ About the Author

I'm K Ajay — a dual-degree ECE + VLSI student with a strong interest in algorithms, systems, and visual logic tools.  
This project is part of my self-learning journey to understand interpreter design, event systems, and browser UI architecture — while reimagining the experience of Scratch from scratch.
